# Pokémon Emerald

Hello! This is an an all-in-one package to expand the Mauville Game Corner, that, in its current state, isn't configurable.
It uses several unused Emerald flags, vars, and FR/LG tracks to make things work... Please keep this in mind if you would like to use this for your own hack.

More specifically, this adds 4 pinball mini-games, Flappy Bird, Block Stacker, Snake, Blackjack, Voltorb Flip, Plinko, Mauville Derby, and Gacha Machines into the Game Corner.

THIS IS CURRENTLY NOT COMPATIBLE WITH EMERALD EXPANSION!

Big thank you to huderlem (Pokemon Pinball to Emerald), and Pokeabbie (Voltorb Flip from Emerald Rogue). All I really did for these was some graphics, music, and code to work with coins. They deserve the real credits here.
Also thank you to Viperio, who made an initial Snake for Pokemon Emerald that I based my code on.
